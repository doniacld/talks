# TinyGo: Getting the upper hen

This talk was given at the [GoWest Conf](https://www.gowestconf.com/) in Utah in 2022 (but I was in remote).  
The goal of this talk was to introduce TinyGo and show a practical and fun application of using Go and TinyGo.

**Talk title**  
TinyGo: Getting the Upper Hen

**Time**  
25 minutes (No Q&A)

**Elevator Pitch**
Do you want to combine your love for Go and a useful personal project? 
How about monitoring your hen house using TinyGo! With any microcontroller and a few materials, 
you will have enough horsepower to build a basic monitoring system and pamper your chickens.

**Talk description**  

TinyGo is a Go compiler for small places such as microcontroller or web. Join Donia for a demo and see live henhouse
temperature and humidity data displayed on dashboards.

Starting from a basic understanding of what TinyGo is, you will learn how to:

- Use the appropriate driver for your hardware
- Retrieve data from a thermometer and humidity captor
- Communicate with your microcontroller using WiFi
- Build a dashboard with temperature and humidity data
- Check that your hens are doing well, from your couch

And, if you still do not want to adopt chickens, you can let your creativity flow by building your own project, using our favorite language.

**Audience**
Go Software Developers willing to use Go for personal projects and fun. (All Attendees)
