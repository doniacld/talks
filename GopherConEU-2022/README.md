**Talk description**  

Do you want to combine your love for Go and a useful personal project? How about monitoring your hen house using TinyGo! 
With any microcontroller and a few materials, you will have enough horsepower to build a basic monitoring system and pamper your chickens.

Starting from only a basic understanding of TinyGo, learn how to:
- Use the appropriate driver for your hardware
- Retrieve data from a thermometer and humidity captor
- Communicate with your microcontroller using WiFi
- Build a dashboard with temperature and humidity data
- Check that your hens are doing well, from your couch

And if you still do not want to adopt chickens, you can let your creativity talk, and you will be able to build your own project using our favourite language.


**Audience**  
Go Software Developers willing to use Go for personal projects and fun.
